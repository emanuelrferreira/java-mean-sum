# Java - Mean and Sum Calculator

A simple Java mini-program created to practice arrays, loops and basic calculations.  
This exercise stores a fixed list of integers, calculates their total sum and their mean, and prints everything to the console.

## Academic Context
This mini-project was developed as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software Development) at the National College of Ireland.  
It represents one of the hands-on Java exercises used to strengthen fundamentals such as arrays, loops and arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Uses an integer array as data source
- Iterates through the array using a loop
- Calculates the sum of all elements
- Calculates the mean (average) value
- Prints the array, sum and mean to the console

## Purpose
This project is part of my Java learning journey and is focused on practicing:
- Array declaration and initialization
- For loops
- Basic arithmetic logic
- Separation of logic in an instantiable class and an application class
